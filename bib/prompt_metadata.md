# Prompt for Nudibranch Metadata CompletionI am developing an R package called `SeaSlugSpectra` that generates biologically inspired colour palettes from images of nudibranch species.I have a list of **42 species** (scientific names in `Genus_species` format) and a corresponding `image_metadata.json` file that needs to be filled with biologically accurate metadata.Please help complete the following 9 metadata fields for each species. The JSON structure will be programmatically integrated into my R project. **Please return the results in structured JSON format** matching the schema below.---## Fields to Complete (for each species)1. `common_name`: Widely recognised English name (if one exists)  2. `location`: General region or known collection area  3. `depth_m`: Typical observed depth range (mean or range preferred, in metres)  4. `habitat`: Type of benthic environment (e.g., coral reef, seagrass, sandy bottom)  5. `size_mm`: Average or maximum adult body size in millimetres  6. `taxonomy`: Structured object with:   - `family`   - `order`7. `diet`: Primary prey or feeding strategy  8. `interesting_facts`: Short fact, ecological or behavioural insight  9. `color_notes`: Description of its colour pattern---## Shared Field (for all species)For all species, you can assume the following identical entry under:```json"extraction_parameters": {  "n_colors": 5,  "method": "kmeans",  "color_space": "RGB",  "resize": false,  "sample_fraction": 1.0,  "seed": 42}```---## Output FormatFor each species, return a JSON object structured as the here example:```json{  "species_name": "Chromodoris willani",  "image_filename": "Chromodoris_willani.jpg",  "common_name": "Willan's chromodoris",  "location": "Lembeh Strait, Indonesia",  "depth_m": 15,  "habitat": "coral reef",  "size_mm": 45,  "taxonomy": {    "family": "Chromodorididae",    "order": "Nudibranchia"  },  "diet": "Sponges",  "interesting_facts": "Named after nudibranch expert Dr. Richard Willan.",  "color_notes": "Sky-blue body with white longitudinal lines and darker gill plumes.",  "extraction_parameters": {    "n_colors": 5,    "method": "kmeans",    "color_space": "RGB",    "resize": false,    "sample_fraction": 1.0,    "seed": 42  }}```You may consult credible sources such as Sea Slug Forum, WoRMS, iNaturalist, Wikipedia, scientific papers, and nudibranch photo ID guides.
